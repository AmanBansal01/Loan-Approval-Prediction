# Loan-Approval-Prediction
 
Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every bank. The main portion of the bankâ€™s assets is directly coming from the profit earned from the loans distributed! Today many banks approve loans after a regress process of verification and validation but still there is no surety whether the applicant will default or not. The prime objective in banking environment is to invest their assets in safe hands.Through this model we can predict whether that applicant is eligible for loan approval or not using machine learning technique. Logistic Regression was used for building this model.
